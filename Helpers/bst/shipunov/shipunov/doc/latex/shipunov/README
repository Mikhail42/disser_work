1. Description
----------------------
 
This is the version 1.0 of 'shipunov' bundle, collection of LaTeX packages and classes, along with one bibliography style, two independent examples and a set of Perl scripts for converting TeX files. Many of them intend to help field biologists and Russian writers, others have wider application.

Most of packages have example files, with `tex' extension and '-ex' postfix. Some of them are in Russian (codepage cp1251, `-ru' postfix). One example is for XeLaTeX and has `-x' postfix. Documentation files have `-doc' postfix. Besides, two examples did not related with any packages, they just demonstrate how to produce reliable forms for biological (morphometry and floristic/faunistic) fieldwork.

Any suggestions concerning this package are highly appreciated.

The Russian mini-review can be found in the "review.tex" file, written by Eugene Baldin, with minor corrections of bundle author.

2. Installation
---------------
 
Extract the zip archive to the $LOCALTEXMF directory of your system. Refresh your filename database. Please see the documentation of your LaTeX distribution for further details.
 
3. Usage notes
--------------
 
For XeTeX example, the XeTeX should be installed, and appropriate system fonts listed in "\set...font" declaration(s). For Russian examples, LH fonts, "cm-super" and "cyrillic" packages should be installed. Russian hyphenation patterns should be loaded via "babel". For using "rusnat" bibliography style, some preparations are needed in the source bib file (example is in the documentation). To run bibtex on aux-file, I recommend the command like "bibtex8 -B -c cp1251.csf rusnat-ex1-ru.aux".

4. History
----------
 
2008/02/xx Version 1. Initial CTAN release. However, the bundle was mantained locally since 1997.
